The .py file is my machine learning model to train itself to predict if a tumor is either malignant or benign. I used a logistic regression model because it is probabilistic. In a hypothetical scenario, I think it is important for a doctor to understand the difference between a 51% likelihood of a malignant tumor vs 99% in regards to avoiding false negatives. With logistic regression, we can see the probability of a sample being either malignant or benign, which is very important for the patient as they try and decide which steps to take for treatment. 

The .docx file is just a word document where I walk through each step of the code and offer some reasoning for why I chose logistic regression and other decisions.
